Spot The Difference quiz machine hustler for Android.

The synopsis is to create an Android application that can use the phone's build in camera to take a photo of a quiz machine whilst playing Spot The Difference, and immediately detect the difference between the two halves of the photo.

Checklist:

- ~~Write/find an algorithm that will competently detect differences in the two halves of the image.~~
    * ~~Firstly, it has to try and minimise the imprecision of photography, so differing light, skews, etc, between the two halves of the image.~~
    * ~~Once aligned and normalised, it must calculate differences in the two images, be that in the colour or actual lines and shapes.~~
    * ~~Finally, it should display these in such a way that they are obvious to the human eye (under the intense pressure of a timed round!)~~
- Incorporate the algorithm into a simple one-button, one-function app.
    * Integrate it with the Android camera interface.
- It should be fast, these rounds fly by and we can't be waitin' 5 seconds for it to do it's thang.
- It should be done by 29th March!
